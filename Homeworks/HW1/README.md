# Homework 1

In future homework, you will explain behaviour of predictive models, but in order to do so, you need to first train a few models.

Add your first homework as a pull request to this folder.

## Task

Train predictive models for a selected ML problem. Compare their performance with a relevant measure.
Submit knitr/notebook script to GitHub (directory `Homeworks/HW1/FirstnameLastname`).

- use any of the datasets listed in `Datasets`, note that some of them are linked with `classification` and other with `regression` problems
- train 2-3 models with different structures (logistic regression, boosting, random forest or other) and evaluate their performance on this dataset (use train/test split or some other evaluation strategy)
- carry out analyses in jupiter notebooks or Rmd (markdown) scripts
- upload a reproducible script together with the final results on GitHub. I remember that the result is not just a code, this one can be automatically generated. The results must be properly commented.

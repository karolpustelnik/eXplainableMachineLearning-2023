# Homework 5

The purpose of the fifth homework is to become familiar with the permutation variable importance method. Calculate these explanations on the model from the first homework and gather conclusions from the results.

Add your fifth homework as a pull request to this folder.

## Deadline 

2022-11-17 EOD

## Task

For a selected data set (you can use data from Homework 1) prepare a knitr/jupiter notebook with the following points.
Submit your results on GitHub to the directory `Homeworks/HW5`.


1. For the selected data set, train at least one tree-based ensemble model (random forest, gbm, catboost or any other boosting)
2. calculate permutational variable importance for the selected model,
3. train three or more candidate models (different variables, different transformations, different model structures) and compare the ranking of important features between these models. Are they similar or different?
4. Comment on the results for points (2) and (3)




## **Important note:**

The submitted homework should consist of two parts (try to render html file out of your jupiter notebook). 

The first part is the key results and comments from points 3,4,7. In this part **PLEASE DO NOT SHOW ANY R/PYTHON CODES, ONLY RESULTS (IMAGES, COMMENTS).**

The second part should start with the word Appendix or Załącznik and should include the reproducible R/PYTHON code used to implement points 1-6.

Such division 1. will make this homework more readable, 2. will create good habits related to reporting.
